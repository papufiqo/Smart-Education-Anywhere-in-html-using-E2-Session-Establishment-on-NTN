Smart Education Anywhere â€” E2 Session Establishment on NTN
ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a prototype education platform that demonstrates how O-RAN E2 Session Establishment over Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can enable digital learning anywhere on Earth, even in remote or underserved areas.

The demo showcases:

Dynamic E2 Session Control with mocked RIC/E2 APIs.

Slice-aware QoS Management (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) for educational traffic.

Adaptive Streaming Player that reacts to link conditions.

NTN Link Simulator with controls for latency, jitter, loss, throughput, blockage, handover, and edge caching.

ðŸš€ Motivation

Education is one of the most powerful use cases for NTN + 6G. Using E2 interface policies and network slicing, we can ensure that:

Video lessons run smoothly in eMBB slices.

Interactive labs use URLLC slices for low-latency control.

IoT classroom devices stream data via mMTC slices.

This demo shows how operators, NGOs, and education ministries could deploy Smart Education Anywhere services.
